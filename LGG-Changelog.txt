	3.	Added coroutine:  HandleEditorButton_Coroutine() to reset the button 
		handlers every 1/2 second
	4.	Added StartCoroutine to end of Start() in KerbalConstructionTime.cs

	The following were done to optimize the code a bit, to remove unnecessary code from a FixedUpdate
	(I saw a FIXME comment and decided to do so)

	5.	Created new function 
			KerbalConstructionTime.UpdateTechlistIconColor() 
		which contains the code which was in the FixedUpdate()
	6.	Commented out the code in FixedUpdate() which was replaced by new method
	5.	Changed the TechList from a list to an IList, and in all methods which change the list, 
		added a call to 
			KerbalConstructionTime.instance.UpdateTechlistIconColor();
		to each method in the IList which changes the list.
